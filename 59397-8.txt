                             Santa Fe Plaza

    [Illustration: Santa Fe Plaza]

During the 1600's, the Santa Fe Plaza extended to the approximate
position of the present Cathedral.

All official, religious, and military functions of Santa Fe took place
in the Plaza, around which were the government buildings, the jail,
customs house and the residences of prominent citizens. The center of
the Plaza was a market place and the scene of social meetings, fiestas,
and cock fights and also the location of the public stock and flogging
post.


In 1884 Governor Martinez de Lejanza erected a wooden bullring in the
Plaza but it was torn down a few months later after it had served as an
ambush for the Ute Indians who attempted an attack on the Palace and the
Governor. It was in the Plaza that the Pueblo Indians revolted against
the Spanish rule in 1680; it was here they capitulated to General Don
Diego De Vargas in 1693. The Plaza was also the end of the Old Santa Fe
Trail from Missouri and El Camino Real from Chihuahua.

    [Illustration: Artist on bench.]


                      The Cathedral of St. Francis

    [Illustration: The Cathedral of St. Francis]

The Cathedral of St. Francis stands prominent at the east end of San
Francisco Street in Santa Fe. Long a dream of world famous Archbishop
John B. Lamy, the Cathedral became a reality (1869-1886). The bishop
himself chose the unusual stone and because certain pioneer Santa Fe
merchants were so helpful with time and money, he allowed a stone marked
with the Star of David to be placed in the center arch of the main
doorway.

As a commemoration of the Reconquest, and to honor the vow of De Vargas
in 1693, a yearly procession carries the wooden statue of the Saint La
Conquistadora to the Rosario Chapel, and back, from the Cathedral.

    [Illustration: Spanish friar and soldiers]

    [Illustration: Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art]

Like Santa Fe is "different", so are its museums. The Museum of Navajo
Ceremonial Art, conceived and founded in 1937 by Miss Mary Cabot
Wheelright, serves to preserve the art, culture and religion of the
Navajo Indian race. Most famous are the sand paintings.

    [Illustration: Museum of International Folk Art]

The Museum of International Folk Art displays, exhibits, holds lectures
and demonstrates folk art and crafts from many countries and regions of
the world.

This cluster of distinctive buildings are located off the old Santa Fe
Trail.

    [Illustration: Laboratory of Anthropology]

Another unit of the museums of New Mexico is the Laboratory of
Anthropology. Primarily a research center, the museum houses a
collection of Indian pottery, textiles and jewelry.


                         The San Miguel Chapel

    [Illustration: The San Miguel Chapel]

THE OLDEST CHURCH STILL IN USE IN THE U.S. IS THE SAN MIGUEL CHAPEL. One
can feel the original adobe altar, walls and floor of this structure
built in 1610 by the Tlaxcala Indians under the direction of the
Franciscan Padres.

Restored, and hanging in the church are many fine old paintings, Icons
and excellent wood carvings.

The oldest bell in USA is there for anyone to touch and ring. The
six-hundred-year old bell was brought from Spain having been cast in
1356. The casting contains silver and gold from the jewelry, rings and
necklaces of the faithful from the village of San Jose, Andalucia,
Spain. A Santa Fean, Senora Loreta Baca Ortiz, ordered the famous bell
to be brought to San Miguel Chapel in 1712.

    [Illustration: Chapel bell]


                               Sena Plaza

    [Illustration: Now a series of quaint shops, the original Sena Plaza
    was the house of the Don Jose' Sena family. The family occupied this
    vast structure with main house, coach house, stable, chicken house
    and servants quarters; all around an interesting central patio.]


                          Sena Plaza Courtyard

    [Illustration: Sena Plaza Courtyard]

    [Illustration: Fine Arts Building of the Museum of New Mexico]

Note the inspiring flowing style of the FINE ARTS MUSEUM, on the Plaza
in Santa Fe. The massive facade has six of the ancient Franciscan
mission churches reproduced; all without destroying the unity of its
appearance. They are: Acoma, San Felipe, Cochiti, Laguna, Santa Ana and
Pecos.

A central patio has shady cloisters, carved corbels and primitive
pillars and vigas.

Other historical and architectural features include the ceilings,
floors, benches, carvings of the grills, the reproduction of the doors
of Santa Clara and the Needle's Eye, along with the great painting of
St. Francis--all truly a work of art to display great art treasure.

    [Illustration: Museum Courtyard]


                          Cross of The Martyrs

    [Illustration: High upon a hill overlooking Santa Fe is the CROSS OF
    THE MARTYRS, erected in honor of the twenty-one Franciscan Padres
    who died at the hands of the Indians on August 10, 1680.]


                        New Mexico State Capitol

    [Illustration: Towering high over the State Capitol building complex
    of Texas Territorian style is this unique tower.]


                              Canyon Road

    [Illustration: Almost every house is historic, and each one houses
    either a craftsman or a well known artist, or a shop; along this
    world-known road that is called Canyon Road in Santa Fe. Originally
    an Indian trail leading to the Pueblo of Pecos.]


                        El Zaguan on Canyon Road

    [Illustration: El Zaguan]

El Zaguan the charming old hacienda with the long passageway from the
house-to-the-patio-to-the-garden. A garden laid out by Adolph Bandelier
with peony bushes and horse-chestnut trees over 100 years old.

Originally the James L. Johnson place in 1849, it became 24 rooms with a
private chapel and a "chocolate room".


                           Santa Fe Ski Basin

    [Illustration: Within a mere 20 minutes from the Santa Fe Plaza you
    ski at 11,000 feet altitude in dry crisp air on a carpet of powdered
    snow which is often 5 to 10 feet deep. The Ski Basin is a "top" ski
    center with all modern facilities.]


                             Santa Fe Opera

    [Illustration: Totally opposite to the expected, in Santa Fe, is the
    Internationally famous Opera under the stars in a fabulous mountain
    setting. The setting, the costumes, the performers, the music--all
    leave you spellbound with admiration ... and all this in Santa Fe!]


                          Miraculous Stairway

    [Illustration: It is said that a carpenter, who must have been a
    Saint, built the "Miraculous Stairway" at Our Lady of Light Chapel
    in Santa Fe. The carpenter used no nails in this stairway with no
    visible means of support--then he disappeared and has not been heard
    from since.]

    [Illustration: Our Lady of Light Chapel which houses the Miraculous
    Stairway.]


                             El Cristo Rey

    [Illustration: El Cristo Rey]

Over 200,000 hand-made mud bricks were used to build the imposing Cristo
Rey Church in Santa Fe. Housed within is the stone reredos, which were
originally commissioned by Gov. Marin del Valle in 1760.

Massive on the outside, the interior is elegant in extreme detail.

    [Illustration: Courtyard of the Donaciano Vigil House]

This hidden courtyard has unusual charm acquired with age. It is part of
the original Donaciano Vigil house of the 1830's. Vigil was Secretary to
Gov. Manuel Armijo during the Mexican regime, as Secretary of New Mexico
under Gov. Kearney in 1846, and later as Civil Governor among other
prominent positions.


                      The Palace of the Governors

    [Illustration: The Palace of the Governors]

Stately and historic, the Palace of the Governors on the Plaza in old
Santa Fe was part of extensive Casa Reales as constructed in 1610-12 as
the larger portion of a fortress and house of government for the Kingdom
of New Mexico under Spanish rule.

Now, officially the Museum of New Mexico, it houses a magnificent
collection of early Spanish and Indian artifacts and The Hall of the
Modern Indian, to the rear of the patio, has an entire Pueblo
reconstruction.

These venerable walls housed the governments of the Pueblo Indians from
1680 to the DeVargas Reconquest, the Spanish Empire 1610-1680 and
1693-1821; The Empire of Mexico 1821-1822; the Republic of Mexico
1823-1846; the U.S. Territory of New Mexico 1846-1900, and for a short
time in 1862 for the U.S. Confederate Army.

    [Illustration: Under The Portal]

The wide, long, Portal of the Palace of the Governors where the Pueblo
Indians display and sell their crafts.

    [Illustration: Chapel of Archbishop Lamy]

The Bishop's Chapel, north of Santa Fe, built for Archbishop John Lamy,
and featured in the book, "Death Comes for the Archbishop" by Willa
Cather.

Restful beauty immortalizing the man and his mission.

    [Illustration: St. John's College]

St. John's College, in Santa Fe, the western campus of the parent 238
year old Annapolis, Md. College of great high learning. St. John's
offers a rare adventure in liberal education to ambitious young men and
women.

    [Illustration: Santa Fe Preparatory School]

The headmaster of the Santa Fe Preparatory School explains that this
outstanding prep. school offers grades 7, 8, 9, 10 and later 11 and 12
for solid basic preparatory education for both boys and girls.

    [Illustration: St. Michael's College]

Dynamic growing St. Michael's College on the south end of Santa Fe,
founded by the Brothers of the Christian Schools. St. Michael's is open
to male students seeking B.A., B.B.A. and B.S. Degrees, plus a
professional curricula in engineering, medicine, dentistry, law and
teaching.

    [Illustration: Indian Dances]

The same original Indian Dances of religious and cultural significance
are held at various times of the year at the many Pueblos of New Mexico.

    [Illustration: NEARBY TESUQUE PUEBLO (Spanish for Town), north of
    Santa Fe, is little changed since the 1600's. The adobe church,
    adobe houses and Kiva, the round bake ovens--all could tell of the
    great generations gone before, and the hundreds that danced the
    ground hard and firm.]

    Peaker," March 1862.]

    [Illustration: The old Pigeon ranch. A critical engagement took
    place here on March 28, 1862.]


A series of Civil War skirmishes along Apache Canyon, March 27-28, 1862,
between Texas Mounted Volunteers and Union Troops, mostly Colorado
Volunteers, climaxed with a decisive battle at Pigeon's Ranch and the
burning of Confederate supply wagons at Canoncita, brought a swift end
to Southern hopes for taking over New Mexico. The battle saved the West
for the Union.

    [Illustration: cannon]


                                Zozobra

    [Illustration: WOW! After Zozobra burns (Old Man Gloom), the Fiesta
    starts!]


                                 Fiesta

    [Illustration: Proclaimed, originally, by General DeVargas as a
    celebration to show gratitude for successful reconquest of Santa Fe,
    this great colorful Fiesta has been proclaimed every year and joyous
    confusion happens every Fall.]


                           Rodeo de Santa Fe

    [Illustration: No matter how you say it, rodeo, or the Spanish
    Ro-day-O, rodeo days in Santa Fe are exciting for young and old for
    all take part in this great western event.]


                               Hyde Park

    [Illustration: As a Santa Fean you are literally only minutes away
    from a rushing stream, tall timber and a cool breeze when you take
    the trail up the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to Hyde State Park where
    facilities are at hand for camping, nature trails, or just to
    photograph nature in the raw. Up ahead is the National Forest and
    mighty wild country if you venture off the road.]


                          The Pecos Wilderness

    [Illustration: Trail riding]

    [Illustration: Pecos Wilderness does still have all the wildness of
    the old west, but with all the beauty and facilities for hunting,
    camping, fishing--you name it!]


                         Historic Pecos Mission

    [Illustration: Ruins]

    [Illustration: One of the most magnificent ruins in New Mexico.
    Located 26 miles southeast of Santa Fe, this mission was constructed
    in 1617 and prospered until the 1800's. Repeated raids by the
    Apaches and Comanches cut down the population until 1828 when the
    last 17 survivors abandoned their ancestral home and went to Jemez
    Pueblo to join their kinfolk there. The Pecos Pueblo and Mission
    ruins are now a State Monument.]

    [Illustration: The Penitentes]

Up Truchas town way look for weather beaten crosses along the road, or
out on the hills and you will know you are in Penitente country. These
very religious people followed Christ in a "true" way at each Easter
time.

    [Illustration: The Sanctuario de Chimayo]

The El Santuario Mission church is not only a picturesque structure, but
it is also famed for its chamber of healing mud; a Lourdes of New
Mexico.

The famous Chimayo rugs and blankets are woven in this area.


                             Los Cerrillos

    [Illustration: Los Cerrillos]

The sun-drenched ghost town of Los Cerrillos, (Little Hills) lies quiet
today, but it was host to many notables like Theodore Roosevelt and Lew
Wallace, a former Governor of N.M. and who also wrote "Ben Hur".

When gold was discovered in the 1800's Cerillos was a whangdoodle
western wide-open town. It hadn't changed much over the years to 1958
when Walt Disney came and filmed the "Nine Lives of Elfego Baca" using
the main Saloon which still stands today, in the same old way.


                               Camel Rock

    [Illustration: Nature formed this "Camel Rock" located along the
    highway north of Santa Fe. Children clamor over the sandstone
    formation, and artists and photographers take its image home.]

    [Illustration: 2-wheeled cart]

    [Illustration: Wherever you wander, along the narrow twisting
    streets of old Santa Fe, you'll encounter interesting doorways.]

    [Illustration: Doorway]


                             Santa Fe Trail

    [Illustration: The Santa Fe Trail ends at the Plaza in old Santa Fe,
    and a big bronze plaque proclaims the spot, but even today you can
    back-track over the trail and still see the wagon wheel impressions
    in many areas where those hearty pioneers came across country. They
    came to trade and seek their fortune in Santa Fe, the enchanting
    city even then, and as different then, as it is today.]

    [Illustration: Old Santa Fe--End of Santa Fe Trail]

While oxen and covered wagons plied the Santa Fe Trail in the early
days, much of that trail is now paved and the road bears that same name.

    [Illustration: And so, Adios Amigos and come often to the true Land
    of Enchantment and the City Different of Santa Fe.]

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
